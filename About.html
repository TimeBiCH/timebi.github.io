      <div class="After">
        After a long time of analysis and hard work, our team<br/>came to the conclusion to create an application which<br/>would help us to prevent people from being affected by<br/>this.  <br/>After 3 years in the industry and being able to notice the<br/>great changes we have been able to make, it fills us with<br/>gratitude and pride to see how what once was seen as a<br/>problem is now beginning to be solved.  <br/>TimeBi is an application that was born out of the need<br/>for a change in lifestyle. There was a large percentage of<br/>people who were affected by the excessive use of social<br/>networks.
